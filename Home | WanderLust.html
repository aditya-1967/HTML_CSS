                travel to open our
                hearts and eyes and learn more about the world than our newspapers will accommodate. We travel to bring
                what little we can, in our ignorance and knowledge, to those parts of the globe whose riches are
                differently dispersed. And we travel, in essence, to become young fools again- to slow time down and get
                taken in, and fall in love once more.
